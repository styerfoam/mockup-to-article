You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
    * These areas have mostly been a refresher
  * What has been easy?
    * Most of it has been as its a refresher
  * What has been difficult?
    * I have lost my muscle memory and some additions have been made since I last studied HTML.
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
    * Interesting question.  I don't recall how I did that exactly.  I am learning to try and see which tests fail and reassess.
